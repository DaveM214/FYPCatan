Plan for final report:

Abstract - 
Background

Introduction
-Possible approaches
-Past work on this area
-Past game playing in general

Overview of techniques
-Move generation
-Heuristics
-MCTS


Details of implementation and algorithmms used
-3rd Party Server and Communications
-MCTS algorithm
-Simulator
-Heuristics Move selection

Results -
Baseline results of AI playing random, heuristically, inbuilt AI
How this compares to other approaches
Qualitative evaluation on playing style of the AI


Conclusions and Future work - 
-How viable is MCTS for this type of game
-How can it be improved
-Limitations and alternative MCTS methods
