Notes on Sridharan 2015 - Random ramblings on the paper as well thoughts on the project

The situations that are described in this situation, will differ someonewhat from those described in this paper. During the boardgame, there is no uncertainty of the certain state. There is only uncertainty in aspects not related to the state of the board. The rationalisation of game moves will probably require less information about the uncertainty.

In catan there will only be uncertainty in certain situations:

-The picking of development cards - Random with certain probabilities - Probability only set at the start when no other players have removed cards but could still use probability to reason about this

-The dice roll is obviously uncertain -> The result we get is random. The result of the dice role will not affect the reasoning over our move.

-Behaviour of other players is obviously uncertain to a degree. We will assume that they act rationally. 

-We know that we can make moves and that most of these will help us. How can we score the possible moves so that we find, rationalise that our move is the best one?



->When we do evaluation of the moves not all of them will be evaluated using the same system. For instance at the starting phase of the game it will be quite feasible to score the move using probability theory and the rules and state of the game board rather than taking in some of the wider factors in account.

->We need to work out some way of organising knowledge. 



->The paper uses ASP which is Answer Set Prolog. More generally ASP refers to Answer Set Programming. Based on stable model semantics, defines a declarative semantics for logic programming with negation as failure.

->To define the domain action Language (AL) is used. This has defined semantics - seems similar to classical planning type language with a few more features.
