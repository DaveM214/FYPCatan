Notes on Paper - "Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Settlers of Catan"

SUMMARY:
-Attempt at using a MCTS in order to play the Settler of Catan game. 
-This particular attempt achieves good results when playing against the AI that comes included with the JSettlers implementation
of the game. When MCTS playthrough is allowed 10,000 moves then it achieves a win rate approaching 50%.
-In this paper there are change to the rules. For example there is a perfect information and there is also no trading which
probably somewhat reduces the performance of the AI. It would be interesting to be able to introduce this.
-Against a human player the AI is better but still relatively easily beaten.
-This paper effectively shows that MCTS is usable both for games that have complex rules.


Useful knowledge when applying to the project:
-It might be necessary to create an environment for the playing of MCTS simulations as JSettlers may be too slow. It would be
having a local JSettlers server vs. having a standalone environment to play the games.
-It is possible to influence the playthrough with both changing the weights and also attributing virtual wins to the game. This,
in our case, could be the outcome of the high level decisions made with ASP.
-Influencing the decisions through the domain knowledge may lead to worse results due to how it interacts with the MCTS. This
means that when we evaluate it in the project it would be a good idea to test it in various configurations in order to see if we
get better results with this different approach.
-There is an inherent bias with the positions that players are seated at on the board. It will be worth looking at this when
evaluating the project and must be taken into account. Ie-> will our AI perform much better or worse whether it performs second or
first?
